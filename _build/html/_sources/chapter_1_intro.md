Wow, that's a big stuff, how could that be a computer anyway? Your father's computer can be even put on his laptop. By the way, let me tell you another secret, your cell phone actually is also a computer. 

Although it's hard to believe, but that's really how a computer looked like the past.
A computer was extremely expensive and large in those days, only university, government or compnay can afford a computer.
Even though those computers were expensive monsters, today your cell phones can easily outperform them.
That feels good to know that you have so powerful tools in your hands, right?

So, how can those monsters are the same thing as your cell phone?
That's because they have same inner structure, now let's take a loot at what's inside them,
don't worry, there is no blood in a computer.

# Welcome to the Python Dojo

Welcome, I'm so glad that you put down your mobile phone and come to our dojo to
learn programming.

I know you've played games on your mobile phone, tablet or computers.
And you have watched cartoon like Frozen, Zootopia or Coco.

At some moment, you cannot help but ask yourself, how are the games and movies made?
Someone may tell that they are made by computer software tools. 
But that answer is not enough, a natural question would be "How are the computer software
tools made?"
The answer is by programming. Someone called programmers made those fantastic software tools through programming, 
then the artists and the storytellers use those software tools to make amazing games and cartoon
movies for us.

So, in this Dojo, you will learn how those programmers work and think, 
and I will teach you the most popular tools they are utilizing.

Girls, boys, welcome to the Dojo of Python, let's train hard to earn yourself a black belt!

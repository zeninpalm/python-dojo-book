# Chapter 1. Know a little about computer
## Time travel

Shhh, I'm going to tell you a secret, we have built a time machine, and you can travel back to the past here, don't tell anyone else.
But our time machine is still not finished yet, so we can only take you back to see how a computer 
looks like when it is invented.

**todo: add a picture of those giant computers**

Wow, that's a big stuff, how could that be a computer anyway? Your father's computer can be even put on his laptop. By the way, let me tell you another secret, your cell phone actually is also a computer. 

Although it's hard to believe, but that's really how a computer looked like the past.
A computer was extremely expensive and large in those days, only university, government or compnay can afford a computer.
Even though those computers were expensive monsters, today your cell phones can easily outperform them.
That feels good to know that you have so powerful tools in your hands, right?

So, how can those monsters are the same thing as your cell phone?
That's because they have same inner structure, now let's take a loot at what's inside them,
and don't worry, there is no blood in a computer.

## Look inside

Well, this is not exactly what you will see if you really tear your Mom's computer apart.
That's because we omit a lot of details in this graph, we are learning to be a Python blackbelt,
let's behave like a master and only pay attention to the most important things.

First you will notice the creepy eyes, ears, and hands. The engineers can them inputs and outputs, or I/O devices. Don't freak out, they just work like human parts. The eyes and ears can see and hear whatever you have to say or show, and then the hands can draw a picture, sing a song, play a movie for you. 

Then you can see there's a notebook, although technically, the engineers call it memory. Once a computer sees or hears what you have to say, it will store all the statements on the notebook , then the big brain of computer, CPU, will read from the notebook or sketch on the notebook, finally, the CPU will tell the computer what to do.

Now you notice that human brain. OMG, are computers some kinds of zombies who like to eat brains? Don't worry, they are not. That stuff which looks like brain is called central processing unit, or CPU. It has a boring name from engineers, but itis the most important part of a computer. All you need to know is that this thing just work like human brain, it can understand what you say to it and command the computer do exactly what you tell it. Pretty cool, huh?

OK, believe it or not, these things are all it takes to be a computer. If you build these components and connect them corrrectly, boom, you got yourself a minimal computer.

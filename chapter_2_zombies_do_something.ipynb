Don't be afraid, these errors are parts of your trainning in this Dojo, and we will teach you more about how to handle those errors. Don't feel down if you see errors, we will see them every day, even if we become a black-belt master.

For now, let me tell you how the computer scientists call the magic words, they call them \"functions\".
